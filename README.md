=>the initial boiler plate react js code was generated by using npx create-react-app

=>in this app i used the mock data of flight details from https://www.mockaroo.com/ => it generates the mock/dummy data based on our requirement

=>then the json data that i get from https://www.mockaroo.com/, i saved in github so that i can use the data as api format

=> i created a file in github flight-mockdata.json in github and added data into it then i generate a page form github so it giving this url => https://kodam-vinay.github.io/flights-api/flight-mockdata.json

=> I used above url to get the data into my app then i converted the pure json data to object format using data.json() by calling the api using fetch() method

=> the json data contain
    "flight_number":9346,
    "departure_city":"New York",
    "arrival_city":"Italy",
    "arrival_date":"2/17/2024",
    "arrival_time":"1:54 AM",
    "airline":"American",
    "price":11312,"id":"00-976-0359"

=> based on search the cities will shows

=> added error handling by using try/catch methods

=> I used the 'date-fns' package to compare the data with my input entered data

=> I used the 'react-icons' package to add some icons into my project
